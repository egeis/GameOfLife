#Unity Simulation of Conway's Game of Life.

Conway’s Game of life is a Discrete model of 2 dimensional Cellular Automation devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a “zero” player simulation starting from an initial state and then playing indefinitely until the simulation is halted by the observer. Advanced versions may include alterations to the rules, the addition of the depth changing the cellular automation to 3 dimensions, or the the addition of more states and rules.
